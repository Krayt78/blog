## Intro

A high-level overview of Dr. Gavin Wood's 2025 Web3 Summit keynote:

## State of Affairs

Polkadot currently spends around $500 million annually on network security. Its revenue comes from selling coretime, but sales haven't yet matched this expense.

A significant issue is capital outflow. Many stakers are in high-tax regions, leading to liquidation. It's estimated that at least 20% of staking rewards are lost to taxes, reducing the ecosystem's retained value.

## Changes Underway

To increase revenue, Polkadot is enhancing both the **value** and **accessibility** of coretime.

### Increasing Coretime Value:
- Elastic-Scaling
- Hub
- JAM

### Improving Access:
- SDK improvements & better docs
- Ethereum compatibility
- PDP
- Bridges

## Near-Term Thoughts

To cut inflation and reduce fund outflow, Polkadot aims to lower security costs to $90 million.

Key proposals:
- End nominator slashing
- Raise validator requirements (e.g., KYC via OpenGov)
- Allow anonymous self-staking
- Fixed fiat rewards: e.g., $5K/month for validators, 3% annual for stakers
- OpenGov to manage reward rates

Gavin also proposed a **capped issuance model**, limiting total DOT to π billion. The issuance would decay, potentially biannually, eventually halting new issuance like Bitcoin.

### Decoupling Issuance & Interest: Buffer Fund

**Issuance ≠ Interest**: Token issuance should not directly fund staking rewards.

Instead, a **buffer fund** would manage this:

- **If Costs < Issuance + Sales**: Buffer absorbs surplus, preventing inflation.
- **If Costs > Issuance + Sales**: Buffer covers the gap, ensuring secure funding.

This model provides economic flexibility and resilience.

## Mid-Term Thoughts

### Native Decentralized Stablecoin

Dr. Wood proposed replacing DOT + USDC/T with a native stablecoin to:
- Reduce dependency on external providers
- Simplify cross-chain payments
- Improve cost and transaction efficiency

### PoP for Security Efficiency

By using **Proof of Personhood**:
- Security shifts from pure staking to identity-based participation
- Lower capital costs
- Inclusive and resilient

### 1-Benefits:
- **Economic independence**
- **Lower costs**
- **Better UX**

### Individuality System for Governance & Security

Polkadot's new **anti-sybil scheme** shifts from staking to:
- Vote-weighted governance
- Incentivized validator backing
- Validator voting caps
- Easy voter-validator matching
- Validator eligibility via PoP, stake, and votes
- Ban poor validators and voters

### 2-Benefits:
- **Reduced costs**
- **Stronger security**
- **Democratized governance**

### Core Disabling in JAM v1.1

Inactive or non-profitable cores can be disabled, saving on validator expenses. This boosts:
- Economic efficiency
- Resource allocation
- Scalability

## Far-Term Thoughts


### JAM & zkJAM Cost Analysis

- zkJAM core: ~$9.3M/year (with 50% overhead)
- Elves/JAM core: ~$916K/year
- With optimizations (PoP, fixed rewards): JAM core cost could drop to ~$144K/year

### Conclusion

To make zkJAM viable:

1. **Cut proving costs by 10–100x**
2. **Open-source GPU tooling** for proof generation
3. **Mid-term zk strategy**:
   - Optimize PVM execution proofs
   - Build modular, open distributed proof systems

4. **Evolve to zkPoPJAM**:
   - Elves/PoPJAM = cost-effective security
   - zkPoPJAM = max security, linear cost

5. **Market differentiation** between Elves/JAM and zkJAM
6. **Explore non-staking security models**
7. **Narrow the cost gap** or prove zk-level security is worth the premium

## Privacy


### Legal Privacy vs Tech-Enabled Privacy

Dr. Wood stressed that **privacy is a legal right**, not just a tech feature.

Tech must:
- Enable users to exercise legal rights
- Avoid overstepping into governance

Implication for Web3:
- Design tools that empower, not control
- Align privacy tooling with laws

### Privacy Tooling & Individuality

Privacy tooling in Polkadot’s Individuality system:
- Empowers users with legal-compliant privacy tools
- Supports identity and data protection
- Enables user control
- Already in use within governance and identity flows

## PoP (Proof-of-Personhood)



### Individuality: Polkadot's PoP System

**Individuality** offers decentralized identity with:
- No central control
- zk-proof privacy
- Full user sovereignty

### Applications:
- Cost-efficient staking
- Secure stablecoin systems
- More trustworthy oracles
- Stronger governance

### Launch Plan:
- **Q4 2025**: Launch DIM1 (POI) and DIM2 (POVI)
- $3M treasury proposal for the “Fairest Airdrop Ever”

This system enhances sybil resistance, expands participation, and supports long-term economic reforms.

## Polkadot's Stablecoin




### A Web3-Native Stablecoin

Gavin outlined the goal for a true Web3 stablecoin—one that is:
- Decentralized
- Rational
- Capital-efficient
- Inclusive
- Scalable
- Universal

### Strategy:
- Avoid reliance on USDC/T
- Focus on sound economic design
- Seamless Polkadot integration

This stablecoin vision supports the broader roadmap of ecosystem independence and robust infrastructure.

## Oracles

Polkadot’s upcoming **Oracle** system is designed to support the **DIM1** identity framework and is tightly integrated with the **Individuality** system.

**Key Functions:**
- Acts as a general-purpose oracle layer
- Initially focused on verifying **Web2 credentials** and performing **OpenGov KYC**
- Provides trusted, decentralized data feeds necessary for identity verification and governance participation

**Use Cases:**
- Confirm social or professional credentials (e.g. LinkedIn, GitHub, government ID)
- Verify KYC compliance for validator candidates and voters in OpenGov
- Enable broader interoperability between Web2 identity and Web3 participation

This Oracle system lays the groundwork for decentralized identity assurance, making it a critical component of Polkadot’s governance and identity roadmap.

## Outposts

### What Are Outposts?

**Outposts** are decentralized physical or digital spaces powered by Web3 technologies. They are designed to reduce the trust and overhead required to manage private spaces in a decentralized way.

These systems blend:
- **Individuality** (identity system)
- **Space provisioning**
- **On-chain collectives**
- **Cryptographic tools**
- **Hardware**
- **Effective user interfaces**

Together, they enable autonomous, self-sustaining Web3 environments with minimal reliance on centralized authorities.
Imagine going into an office space and being allowed in with just your web3 identity and no other credentials needed.

### Current Development

Three outposts are currently in development, with more planned:

- **The Emergent College** – Lisbon  
- **Club Kusama** – Berlin  
- **Single Malta** – Malta  

Each Outpost represents a live experiment in applying decentralized governance, identity, and infrastructure to real-world community spaces.
