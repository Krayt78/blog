## State of affairs
Currently the security of polkadot costs 500 million $ per year.
Polkadot's revenue model is to sell core time in exchange for that security. Unfortunately the cost is not matched by coretime sales revenue yet.
This wouldnt be a problem if the money stayed in our economy but atm it is difficult to estimate how much of it stays.
But we know that a lot of stakers live in high-tax jurisdiction forcing liquidation (its not crazy to assume at least 20% tax on said staking rewards).

## Changes Underway
Currently we need to increase the value and the ease of access to coretime, which is the main revenue generator of Polkadot.
Here are the changes underway for;
Improving the value of coretime:
- Elastic-Scaling
- Hub
- JAM

Improving access to coretime :
- SDK & better documentation
- Ethereum compatibility
- PDP
- Bridges

### Explanation
To Fight the current inflation and exodus of funds, the plan is to reduce the security cost of Polkadot to approx 90 million $.
Here are the suggestions to get there : 
- Remove nominator slashing.
- In return increase the bar to be a validator (OpenGov KYC/interview)
- Allow self stakers to be anonymous
- Set a fixed reward rate for validators payed in Fiat (ex 5000$ a month)
- Set a fixed Fiat reward for stakers (e.g. 3% at 1 million$ stake)
- OpenGov would be able to set those values

Also Gavin talked about commiting to long-term reponsibility via a fixed issuance curve for Dot.
This would cap the max issuance to pi billion dots. This issuance curve would decay over time, the exact way would have to be discussed but we think it could be biannually.
This would mean that like bitcoin, dot would have a capped supply and that as time goes by the amount of tokens minted would reduce until reaching the cap.

### Decoupling Issuance and Interest: The Buffer Fund Concept

Dr. Wood introduced a crucial economic concept: **"Issuance != Interest."** This fundamental principle decouples the network's token issuance from traditional interest payments to stakers, creating a more flexible economic model.

To manage this new approach, the proposal includes establishing a **"buffer-fund"** that provides governance over economic policy. This fund would dynamically manage token issuance based on network security costs:

**When Security Costs < Issuance + Sales:**
- The buffer fund "soaks up" excess issuance
- Prevents inflationary pressures when security is economically efficient
- Maintains price stability during periods of low security costs

**When Security Costs > Issuance + Sales:**
- The buffer fund "subsidises" the deficit
- Ensures adequate funding for network security
- Maintains robust security even during high-cost periods

This buffer fund mechanism creates a more stable and predictable economic environment, where security costs are managed independently of fixed interest rates, allowing for greater flexibility and resilience against market fluctuations.

## Explanation

### Native Decentralized Stablecoin Strategy

Dr. Wood's mid-term vision focuses on developing a **native, decentralized stablecoin** as a core component of Polkadot's economic infrastructure. This represents a strategic shift away from relying on external stablecoins.

**Key Strategic Changes:**

1. **Move outgoing payments from DOT+USDC/T into native stablecoin**
   - Transition away from using DOT combined with external stablecoins (USDC/USDT)
   - Create a self-contained economic ecosystem within Polkadot
   - Reduce dependency on external stablecoin providers
   - Improve transaction efficiency and reduce cross-chain complexity

2. **Utilize PoP to further reduce security costs**
   - Implement **Proof of Personhood (PoP)** mechanisms
   - Leverage personhood-based security models instead of pure staking
   - Achieve greater cost efficiency in network security
   - Create more inclusive participation models

### Benefits of This Approach:

**Economic Independence:**
- Reduces reliance on external stablecoin providers
- Creates a more self-sufficient Polkadot ecosystem
- Provides better control over monetary policy within the network

**Cost Efficiency:**
- PoP mechanisms can be more cost-effective than traditional staking
- Reduces the overall security costs of the network
- Enables more participants to contribute to network security

**User Experience:**
- Simplified payment flows using native stablecoin
- Reduced complexity in cross-chain transactions
- More predictable transaction costs and settlement times

This mid-term strategy represents a significant evolution toward a more autonomous and efficient Polkadot ecosystem, with the native stablecoin serving as the foundation for internal economic activity.

### Leveraging Polkadot Individuality System

Dr. Wood's strategy also includes leveraging the **new Polkadot Individuality system** to reduce security costs through a **strong anti-sybil scheme**. This approach can make a major contribution to security while reducing overall costs.

**Key Components of the Anti-Sybil Scheme:**

1. **Switch staking for voting**
   - Move from pure staking mechanisms to voting-based participation
   - Create more democratic governance structures
   - Reduce capital requirements for participation

2. **Increase weight of voters who back good validators**
   - Reward voters who support reliable validators
   - Create incentives for quality validator selection
   - Improve overall network reliability

3. **Limit vote count of validators**
   - Prevent concentration of voting power
   - Ensure decentralization of the network
   - Maintain fair distribution of influence

4. **Easy match-making** 
   - Simplify the process of connecting voters with validators
   - Improve user experience in the governance system
   - Increase participation rates

5. **Validators require PoP, stake and votes**
   - Multi-factor requirements for validator participation
   - Proof of Personhood ensures unique identity
   - Combined stake and voting requirements for security

6. **Ban bad validators & their voters**
   - Implement consequences for poor performance
   - Create accountability mechanisms
   - Maintain network quality and security

### Benefits of This Approach:

**Cost Reduction:**
- Anti-sybil mechanisms reduce the need for expensive staking requirements
- Voting-based participation is more cost-effective than pure staking
- Proof of Personhood provides security without high capital costs

**Improved Security:**
- Multi-factor validation requirements enhance network security
- Accountability mechanisms prevent malicious behavior
- Decentralized voting prevents concentration of power

**Better Governance:**
- Democratic voting structures improve network governance
- Quality-based rewards incentivize good behavior
- Simplified participation increases engagement

This comprehensive approach combines economic innovation (native stablecoin) with governance improvements (Individuality system) to create a more efficient, secure, and inclusive Polkadot ecosystem.

### Core-Disabling in JAM (v1.1)

Another crucial mid-term strategy is the introduction of **core-disabling into JAM (v1.1)**. This mechanism addresses the economic efficiency of validator operations and core utilization.

**Purpose and Benefits:**

- **Cost Management**: If a core does not generate sufficient monthly costs (i.e., it's not economically viable or active)
- **Disability Feature**: The system will introduce the ability to disable that core
- **Validator Cost Avoidance**: By disabling non-performing cores, the network can avoid most of the associated validator costs

**Economic Impact:**

This feature ensures that resources are not wasted on underutilized or unprofitable cores, leading to:
- Significant cost savings for the network
- Improved overall economic efficiency
- Better resource allocation
- Enhanced network sustainability

**Operational Benefits:**

- **Dynamic Resource Management**: Cores can be enabled/disabled based on demand and profitability
- **Reduced Waste**: Eliminates costs associated with inactive or unprofitable cores
- **Scalability**: Allows the network to scale resources up or down based on actual usage
- **Economic Sustainability**: Contributes to the long-term financial health of the Polkadot ecosystem

This core-disabling mechanism represents a practical approach to cost optimization, ensuring that the network only pays for active, economically viable cores while maintaining the flexibility to reactivate them when conditions improve.

## Explanation

## JAM & ZkJAM

At the moment the estimated ideal attainable annual cost for continuois execution proving of a single zkJAM core is 9,315,426$. 
This assumes the ability to disctribute at 50% cost overhead.

For comparison, a single Elves/Jam core's estimated annual cost is 916,800$

If we take into parameters the changes that were proposed in the [[Near Term thoughts chapter]], then it is estimated that a single code of Elves/JAM could cost 270k$ per year to run.

If we also take into account proof of personhood and a fixed fiat reward rate for validators of 4k$/month then the price of runnign a core of Elves/JAM could be reduced to 144k$/year.

## Explanation

Based on Dr. Gavin Wood's analysis, making zkJAM a sensible idea would require several key developments:

### 1. **Dramatic Reduction in Proof Costs**
The current estimated annual cost for continuous execution proving of a single zkJAM core is $9.3 million. To make this economically viable, proof costs need to reduce by **10-100x further**. This would require:
- Breakthroughs in zero-knowledge proof technology
- More efficient proving algorithms
- Hardware acceleration improvements

### 2. **Open Source Tooling for GPU Distribution**
Developing robust, open-source tooling for efficient distribution of proof generation into GPU clusters is essential. This would:
- Reduce the 50% cost overhead currently assumed
- Enable better resource utilization
- Lower barriers to entry for validators

### 3. **Proposed zk Strategy (Mid-term)**
Dr. Wood outlined a specific mid-term strategy for advancing zk technology:

**Collaborate, support and develop well-optimized proof-generation tooling** - Since state-of-the-art solutions are currently closed source, there's a critical need for open-source alternatives that can compete with proprietary solutions.

**Focus particularly on:**
- **PVM execution proofs** - Optimizing proof generation for Polkadot's ParaVM execution environment
- **Distributed proof-generation** - Creating systems that can efficiently distribute proof generation across multiple nodes
- **Modular, open system** - Building a flexible architecture capable of keeping up with rapidly evolving state-of-the-art zk technology

### 4. **Far-term Evolution: zkPoPJAM Strategy**
The long-term vision involves evolving into **zkPoPJAM** with specific prerequisites and multi-modal security:

**Prerequisites for zkPoPJAM:**
- zk technology must drop in price sufficiently
- Economically insufficient cores utilization must be addressed

**Multi-modal Security Development:**
- **Elves/PoPJAM**: Provides "good security level at minimal marginal cost"
- **ZkPoPJAM**: Offers "ultimate" security at substantial but linear cost

**Technical Requirements:**
- **Settlement/JAM-chain correctness** through recursive zk-proof
- **Finality and storage** via anti-sybil POP-based mechanisms

### 5. **Market Differentiation Strategy**
Creating clear market differentiation between perfect security (zkJAM) and bounded security (Elves/JAM) is crucial. The ecosystem needs:
- Clear value propositions for each approach
- Understanding of when perfect security justifies the cost premium
- Market demand that can support the higher costs

### 6. **Alternative Security Models**
Exploring non-stake-based protocols for secure storage and settlement could provide:
- More cost-effective security mechanisms
- Reduced reliance on expensive staking requirements
- New economic models for network security

### 7. **Economic Viability Threshold**
Currently, a single Elves/JAM core could cost as little as $144k/year with proposed optimizations, while zkJAM remains at $9.3 million. For zkJAM to become sensible, either:
- The cost gap must narrow significantly (zkJAM costs need to drop to under $1 million/year)
- Or the value proposition of perfect security must justify the 65x cost premium

### The Path Forward
zkJAM represents an ambitious vision for perfect security in blockchain execution, but its adoption depends on solving fundamental economic and technical challenges. The success of this approach will require coordinated progress across cryptography research, hardware optimization, and market development. The mid-term zk strategy provides a clear roadmap for developing the necessary tooling and infrastructure, while the far-term vision of zkPoPJAM offers a multi-modal security approach that can adapt to different cost and security requirements. The evolution from JAM to zkPoPJAM will be driven by cost reductions and the need for different security levels in the ecosystem.

### Explanation

### Personal Privacy: Legal Framework and Technology's Role

Dr. Wood addressed the fundamental nature of personal privacy in the context of Web3 and blockchain technology, emphasizing the distinction between legal rights and technological capabilities.

**Legal Foundation of Privacy:**

"Many jurisdictions explicitly make affordances for personal privacy" - This statement highlights that privacy is not just a technological concept but a **legal right** recognized by governments and legal systems worldwide. Various jurisdictions have established frameworks, regulations, and protections for personal privacy, including:
- Data protection laws (GDPR, CCPA, etc.)
- Constitutional privacy rights
- Industry-specific privacy regulations
- International privacy agreements

**Technology's Enabling Role:**

The slide presents two key principles about technology and privacy:

1. **"Will always be a case of users exercising whatever legal rights they have"**
   - Privacy protection ultimately depends on users understanding and exercising their legal rights
   - Technology can provide tools, but users must actively assert their privacy rights
   - Legal frameworks provide the foundation for privacy protection

2. **"Tech can only enable, not guide"**
   - Technology serves as an enabler for privacy protection
   - Technology cannot replace or override legal frameworks
   - The responsibility for privacy protection lies with legal systems and user action

**Implications for Web3 and Polkadot:**

This perspective has important implications for blockchain technology:

**User Empowerment:**
- Users must be educated about their privacy rights
- Technology should provide tools for users to exercise their rights
- Privacy protection requires active user participation

**Legal Compliance:**
- Blockchain projects must respect existing privacy laws
- Technology should be designed to enable legal compliance
- Privacy features should align with legal frameworks

**Technology Design:**
- Build privacy-enabling features rather than privacy-guiding systems
- Provide users with tools to protect their privacy
- Ensure technology supports rather than replaces legal rights

This approach emphasizes that while blockchain technology can provide powerful privacy tools, the ultimate protection of personal privacy depends on legal frameworks and user awareness of their rights.

### Privacy Tooling and the Individuality System

Dr. Wood further elaborated on how privacy is practically implemented through technology, specifically through **tooling designed to help exercise personal privacy within documented and accepted limits of reason**.

**The Role of Privacy Tooling:**

This tooling serves several important functions:
- **Enables Privacy Exercise**: Provides users with practical tools to assert their privacy rights
- **Operates Within Reasonable Limits**: Functions within established legal and ethical boundaries
- **Balances Privacy and Functionality**: Ensures privacy protection without compromising system usability
- **Complies with Legal Frameworks**: Works within documented and accepted legal parameters

**Integration with the Individuality System:**

The slide specifically mentions that this privacy tooling is **"Already being used for elements of Individuality system."** This reveals a practical application of privacy-enhancing technologies within Polkadot's broader Individuality framework.

**Key Applications:**

1. **Identity Management**: Privacy tooling helps users control their identity information within the Individuality system
2. **Data Protection**: Ensures personal data is handled according to privacy principles
3. **User Control**: Provides users with tools to manage their privacy preferences
4. **Legal Compliance**: Ensures the Individuality system operates within privacy laws and regulations

**Benefits of This Integration:**

- **Practical Privacy**: Users have concrete tools to protect their privacy
- **System Integration**: Privacy features are built into the core Individuality system
- **Legal Alignment**: Technology operates within established legal frameworks
- **User Empowerment**: Individuals can actively manage their privacy within the ecosystem

This approach demonstrates how Polkadot is implementing privacy not just as a concept, but as a practical, tool-enabled feature that users can actively exercise within the Individuality system, all while respecting legal boundaries and reasonable limits.

### Explanation

### Individuality: The Polkadot Native Proof-of-Personhood System

Dr. Wood presented **Individuality** as Polkadot's native Proof-of-Personhood (PoP) system, describing it as a potential "silver bullet" for addressing key challenges in the blockchain ecosystem.

**Core Concept:**

Individuality represents a comprehensive approach to establishing unique human identity on the blockchain without compromising privacy or relying on centralized authorities. The system is designed to provide strong sybil resistance while maintaining Web3 ideals.

**Web3 Ideals Alignment:**

The system is built around three fundamental principles:

1. **"No confessional"** - No centralized authority that holds or controls identity information
2. **"No key-master"** - No single entity that can access or manipulate the system
3. **"zk-powered privacy"** - Uses zero-knowledge proofs to protect user privacy
4. **"No reliance whatsoever on authorities"** - Complete decentralization and user sovereignty

**Potential Impact:**

Dr. Wood emphasized that Individuality could be a **"game-changer"** for multiple blockchain applications:

**Strong Sybil Resistance:**
- Provides a vector to dramatically increase participation
- Reduces capital needs and costs
- Enables more inclusive participation models

**Broad Applications:**
- **Staking**: More efficient and inclusive staking mechanisms
- **Stablecoin**: Enhanced security and compliance for stablecoin systems
- **Marketing**: Better targeting and user engagement
- **Oracles**: Improved reliability and trust in data feeds
- **Governance**: More democratic and representative voting systems

**Launch Timeline and Implementation:**

The system is scheduled to launch in **Q4 2025** with two key components:

1. **DIM1 (POI)** - Proof of Individuality
2. **DIM2 (POVI)** - Proof of Verified Individuality

**Treasury Proposal:**
- A significant treasury proposal is planned: **$3 million for "Fairest Airdrop Ever"**
- This suggests a major distribution event to onboard users to the Individuality system
- The "fairest" designation implies sophisticated anti-sybil mechanisms to ensure equitable distribution

**Strategic Significance:**

Individuality represents a fundamental shift in how identity and participation are managed in the Polkadot ecosystem:

**Economic Benefits:**
- Reduces security costs through better sybil resistance
- Enables more efficient capital allocation
- Creates more inclusive participation models

**Technical Innovation:**
- Combines privacy-preserving technology with identity verification
- Uses zero-knowledge proofs to maintain privacy
- Provides strong sybil resistance without centralized control

**Ecosystem Impact:**
- Enables new use cases across multiple blockchain applications
- Improves governance and participation mechanisms
- Creates a foundation for more sophisticated DeFi and social applications

This system represents a key component of Polkadot's long-term vision, providing the identity infrastructure needed to support the broader economic and governance improvements outlined in the near and mid-term strategies.
